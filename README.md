## Adding email functionality to the contact section of the project involves a few simple steps:

### Set Up EmailJS:
- Begin by including the EmailJS script in your project. EmailJS is a service that allows you to send emails directly from your web page.

### Initialize EmailJS:
- Once you've included the EmailJS script, initialize it by providing your unique user ID. You can obtain a user ID by signing up on the EmailJS website.

### Create a Contact Form:
- In the contact section of your webpage, design a form that includes fields for the user's name, email, subject, message, and a button to send the email.

### Write JavaScript Function:
- Develop a JavaScript function (e.g., sendmail) that captures the data entered into the form. This function will use EmailJS to send an email with the provided information.

### Refresh the Page:
- After successfully sending the email, you can include a line of code to refresh the page. This step ensures that the user sees a confirmation message and starts with a clean form for any additional inquiries.

### Style Your Form (Optional):
- Optionally, you can use CSS to style your contact form. This step helps in making your form visually appealing and consistent with the design of your project.


By following these steps, users will be able to fill out the contact form, click the "Send" button, receive a confirmation alert, and see the page refresh for a smooth user experience.
